						Capri is from Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, a town that people stopped driving through. They took the new bypass instead, loving the straight line from work to home and back again. Capri lived right on main street with a front row seat to watch her town dwindle. No foot traffic and no movie theater, but still this was home. She wouldn’t understand the signs of economic erosion and how they shaped her until she moved across the country to earn her BA in Theater at Wesleyan University. Where, inexplicably, she began to always take the long route home.

						She grew as an artist, earning her MFA in Acting at Northwestern University, and found that two things remained true no matter where she lived: 1. Progress is a slippery thing, and 2. Joy, beauty, queerness, and good food always find a way. She makes work that is fueled by collective imagination, daring audiences to believe that another world is within reach, as long as we don’t take the bypass.

						Capri is an actor, a writer, a lover, and a dreamer. She makes plays, films and short fiction. Thank you for being here. Let’s make something together.
